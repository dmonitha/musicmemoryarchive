# Music Memory Archive Website
A website using Angular &amp; .Net that demonstrates all the cool things we learned in COMP 584 class!

Branch - **/frontend**

Contains the code for UI built using Angular

Branch - **/backend**

Contains the backend code for APIs built using ASP.Net & C#

Features implemented - 
- Single Page Application(SPA)

Why my website is different from others -

**MVC Architecture-**
- Implemented APIs for GET & POST calls that communicates with database and client
- Enhanced logic to minimize re-writting of code

**Authentication & Authorization-**
- Register functionality
- Login functionality

**ORM**
- Implemented DTO called "AlbumDTO" that minimizes method calls between client and server.
